This file contains a log of changes made to the file
"/home/bwelch/ws/httpd1.2/htdocs/cgi-bin/big.cgi".  It is kept around during Mx edit
sessions for use in undo-ing, and also as a backup in
case a crash occurs.  If you see this log, it means
that either someone's editing the file, or Mx crashed
during an edit.  If a crash occurred, you can recover
all the changes by re-running Mx on the above-named
file, and selecting the "Recover and Delete Log" option.
If you don't care about recovery, you can just delete
the log.
