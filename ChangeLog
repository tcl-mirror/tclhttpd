	* lib/doc.tcl  Created DocAccessHook and moved authentication
	checking out of DocDomain and into DocAccessHook.  Also did
	cleanup so that Doc_Virtual would work if you used Doc_AddRoot
	to splice in other directory trees into the URL tree.  The
	nice side effect of DocAccessHook is that you can create
	a file system structure to parallel application-direct URLs,
	(e.g., /debug and /status) and put .htaccess or .tclaccess
	files in them to control access to the built in URLs.
	* lib/url.tcl  Simplified Url_Dispatch by removing the
	UrlCache array.  Also added Url_PrefixMatch
	* lib/auth.tcl  Define env(REMOTE_USER) and env(AUTH_TYPE) in the
	case that .tclaccess files are used to check Basic Authentication.
	* REMOVED lib/base64.tcl in favor of the Standard Tcl Library
	base64 package. (You can find it in deprecated/base64.tcl)

	* lib/url.tcl	Added Url_AccessInstall and changed Url_Dispatch
	to call registered access control hooks before dispatching to
	domain handlers.  Changed URL redirect scheme to not use the
	UrlCache hack, but to use a URL access control hook.
	* lib/redirect.tcl: Added a URL access control hook to implement
	per-URL redirects.
	* lib/httpd.tcl: unbroke Httpd_RedirectSelf
	* lib/thread.tcl: fixed use of undefined procedure
	* lib/admin.tcl: Removed most of the redirect code from here.
	* htdocs/redirect: Added sample redirect file.  This is loaded
	during startup and when you poke the /redirect/reload direct URL.
	* bin/httpd.tcl: added initialization for the redirect module.

	* lib/mail.tcl: changed calls to Base64 library to use the
