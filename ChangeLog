	* lib/url.tcl	Added Url_AccessInstall and changed Url_Dispatch
	to call registered access control hooks before dispatching to
	domain handlers.  Changed URL redirect scheme to not use the
	UrlCache hack, but to use a URL access control hook.
	* lib/redirect.tcl: Added a URL access control hook to implement
	per-URL redirects.
	* lib/httpd.tcl: unbroke Httpd_RedirectSelf
	* lib/thread.tcl: fixed use of undefined procedure
	* lib/admin.tcl: Removed most of the redirect code from here.
	* htdocs/redirect: Added sample redirect file.  This is loaded
	during startup and when you poke the /redirect/reload direct URL.
	* bin/httpd.tcl: added initialization for the redirect module.
