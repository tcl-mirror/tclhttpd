This is a bundled distribution of TclHttpd, Tcl, the
Standard Tcl Library, and the Thread extension.

If you already have tcl 8.3 installed, then you can probably
run the Tcl Web Server directly from this distribtuion without
doing any installation steps:

cd tclhttpd3.3/bin
tclsh8.3 httpd.tcl -port 8001 -debug 1

If you get complaints about missing the Standard Tcl Library,
then you can install just that by running the install.sh script
in the tcllib0.8 directory.

If you want a clean install of everything, including a Tcl 8.3.2
that has thread enabled, then use the Makefile in the top-level directory.
This will compile things under the build directory, segregating
by platform into different subdirectories.

SSL Note:

Tcl 8.3.1 and the TLS 1.3 extension (not included here) have
some bugs.  You should use Tcl 8.3.2 and TLS 1.4 for stable SSL performance.
