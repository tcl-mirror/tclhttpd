This is a bundled distribution of TclHttpd, Tcl, the
Standard Tcl Library, and the Thread extension.

If you already have tcl 8.3 installed, then you can probably
run the Tcl Web Server directly from this distribtuion without
doing any installation steps:

cd tclhttpd3.0.2/bin
tclsh8.3 httpd.tcl -port 8001 -debug 1

If you get complaints about missing the Standard Tcl Library,
then you can install just that by running the install.sh script
in the tcllib0.4 directory.

If you want a clean install of everything, including a Tcl 8.3.1
that has thread enabled, then use the CONFIG and MAKE scripts
in the build directory.

First, edit CONFIG to set the PREFIX and PLATFORM appropriately
for your site.  PREFIX determines the installation location of
all the software.  The PLATFORM is used to keep the binaries for
different platforms (e.g., Linux and Solaris) partitioned.
If you have more than one platform, you can edit CONFIG and
change the PLATFORM variable and re-run it.

To compile and install the software, edit MAKE so that the
PLATFORM value matches what you configured.   Then run MAKE.
