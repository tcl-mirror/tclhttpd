Version: 2.2.1
Last update: Wed Jul  7 13:05:56 PDT 1999

It requires Tcl7.5 and Tk4.1, or higher.
It works with the latest 8.0 release.
I'd avoid 8.0b1 because fcopy doesn't handle errors right.
Tcl 8.0p2 or later (e.g., 8.0.4) is the best release to use with TclHttpd.

This runs under either tclsh or wish.
With wish you get a simple GUI that shows some counters.

For a quick test that runs a server on port 8015, do
UNIX:
	tclsh bin/httpd.tcl -debug
Windows:
	Run wish or tclsh and source bin/httpd.tcl
Macintosh:
	You'll need to edit httpd and tune the file names because I
	haven't gotten around to this yet. Then source the file from
	the source menu.  Send me a copy of your tuned script, please.

For a complete set of command line options, do
httpd.tcl -help
This lets you set basic parameters like port number and server name.

Version 2.1.6 introduces a configuration file, tclhttpd.rc
You can edit this to tune the set of modules used by the server,
or to hardwire the port, etc.

If you have Scotty installed, then you can try out the SNMP demo.
You'll need to arrange to have the Tnm*.so library on the
auto_path for your shell.  I have found that 2.1.5 works
with 8.0a2, but not with 8.0b1 because Tcl_GetFile has gone.
