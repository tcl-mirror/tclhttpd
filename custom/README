custom/README

This directory is the default location for adding custom code to TclHttpd.
There are a couple of sample files here, but they are non critical and you
can delete them, ignore them, or change the location of this custom code
directory as noted below.

The custom code location is specified with the -library command line argument or the
Config library <pathname>
configuration file entry.

The server sources everything in this directory in alphabetical order.
This is done by the default "thread main" script, which is by default
bin/httpdthread.tcl
If you run with "-debug 1" you'll get feedback as the code here is loaded.
Otherwise you only see any errors raised during the process.
