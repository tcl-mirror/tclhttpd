There are two ways you can organise the .so files that you
compile from these sources

1)
Copy the compiled .so files from the Linux or Solaris
directories into the lib (or lib/Binaries) directory, then recreate
your pkgIndex.tcl file by running tclsh in that directory
and doing
pkg_mkIndex . *.tcl *.so

2) Create a platform-specific directory that matches your
os and osVersion underneath the lib directory, for example:
	mkdir ../lib/SunOS/5.5.1
	cp Solaris/* ../lib/SunOS/5.5.1
This works because the httpd script adds this to your auto_path
$Httpd(library)/Binaries/$tcl_platform(os)
$Httpd(library)/Binaries/$tcl_platform(os)/$tcl_platform(osVersion)
